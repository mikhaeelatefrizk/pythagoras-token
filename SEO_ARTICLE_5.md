# How to Buy Pythagoras (PYTH) Token: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Your Guide to Acquiring the World's First Utility Memecoin on the Polygon Network

---

So, you've learned about Pythagoras (PYTH), the world's first utility memecoin, and you're ready to join the mathematical revolution. You're excited about the gas optimization tool, the instant liquidity of the bonding curve, and the privacy protection suite. But how do you actually buy the token?

This guide will walk you through the process of buying Pythagoras (PYTH) on the Polygon network, step by step. We'll cover everything from setting up a wallet to executing the trade.

### Before You Begin: What You'll Need

To buy Pythagoras (PYTH), you'll need a few things:

*   **A cryptocurrency wallet that supports the Polygon network:** We recommend MetaMask, as it is the most popular and user-friendly wallet for DeFi.
*   **MATIC tokens:** MATIC is the native token of the Polygon network, and you'll need it to pay for gas fees.
*   **A desire to be part of the future of memecoins!**

### Step 1: Set Up Your MetaMask Wallet

If you don't already have a MetaMask wallet, you'll need to set one up. You can download the MetaMask extension for your browser from the official website: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

Once you've installed the extension, follow the instructions to create a new wallet. **Be sure to write down your seed phrase and store it in a safe place.** Your seed phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you forget your password.

### Step 2: Add the Polygon Network to MetaMask

By default, MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum network. To buy Pythagoras (PYTH), you'll need to add the Polygon network to your wallet. Here's how:

1.  Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown at the top of the screen.
2.  Click on "Add Network."
3.  Enter the following information:
    *   **Network Name:** Polygon
    *   **New RPC URL:** https://polygon-rpc.com/
    *   **Chain ID:** 137
    *   **Currency Symbol:** MATIC
    *   **Block Explorer URL:** https://polygonscan.com/
4.  Click "Save."

Your wallet is now connected to the Polygon network.

### Step 3: Get Some MATIC

You'll need MATIC to pay for gas fees on the Polygon network. You can buy MATIC on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance and then withdraw it to your MetaMask wallet. Make sure you withdraw it to your Polygon address, not your Ethereum address.

Alternatively, you can use a bridge to transfer funds from another network to the Polygon network. The official Polygon bridge can be found here: [https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge)

### Step 4: Go to the Pythagoras Website

Once you have MATIC in your wallet, you're ready to buy Pythagoras (PYTH). Go to the official Pythagoras website (the URL will be announced on our official channels) and connect your MetaMask wallet.

### Step 5: Use the Bonding Curve to Buy PYTH

The Pythagoras website will have a simple interface that allows you to buy PYTH using the bonding curve. Here's how it works:

1.  Enter the amount of MATIC you want to spend.
2.  The interface will show you how many PYTH tokens you will receive.
3.  Click "Buy."
4.  MetaMask will pop up and ask you to confirm the transaction. Review the details and click "Confirm."

Once the transaction is confirmed, the PYTH tokens will be sent to your wallet.

### Step 6: Add the PYTH Token to MetaMask

To see your PYTH tokens in your MetaMask wallet, you'll need to add the token to your wallet. Here's how:

1.  Open MetaMask and click on the "Assets" tab.
2.  Scroll down and click on "Import tokens."
3.  Enter the following information:
    *   **Token Contract Address:** `0x0a5d91537E38C25F772dea78914737582D1C1C47`
    *   **Token Symbol:** PYTH
    *   **Token Decimal:** 18
4.  Click "Add Custom Token."

You will now be able to see your PYTH balance in your MetaMask wallet.
